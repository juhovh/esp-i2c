# esp-i2c

There were many different I2C drivers for ESP8266 out there, but I couldn't get
any of them to work with me DS3231 RTC chip, therefore I wrote my own. Inspired
by all the existing implementations and I2C documentation, but a standalone
implementation released very liberally under MIT license.
